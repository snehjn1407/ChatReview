# Product Data API

This project serves static product data via an Express server for various product categories (e.g., laptops, headphones, jewelry). This is not connected to any external API, but the server acts as an API endpoint serving predefined data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies.

Notes
This is a static product data API.
The data is hardcoded in the server, and there's no external database or API integration in this project yet.
You can enhance the project by connecting it to external APIs in the future to pull real-time data.
